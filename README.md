# K.K. Speech Parser

A tool that allows you to convert word into "KK Speech".
Each word will get broken down into its CMU phonetic components,
and associated with the closest K.K. Slider sound.

Please note that this system isn't perfect, and may fail with uncommon words!

K.K. Slider has about 5 distinct singing sounds:
- "Nah"
- "Me"
- "Now"
- "Way"
- "Oh"

The sounds chosen by this tool are approximates, and may need to be finely tuned yourself.
